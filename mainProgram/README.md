<b>calculatorProgram</b><br><br>
this `calculatorProgram` is a calculator that i am making, with  easter eggs for me and my friends<br>
the `easterEgg()` function is the easter egg conformation.<br>
if you want to add an easter egg, ask in the discussions.<br>


to be clear the `mainProgram` can only do simple operations, and cant get an answer that is 10+, any answer higher than 10 will either say 3RR03, or wont be avalible

the `im_an_idiot` can do simple operations with unlimited number size(to a certain degree(i forgot how large a single `<string>` string can hold))
