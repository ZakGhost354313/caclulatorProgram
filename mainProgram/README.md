<b>calculatorProgram</b><br><br>
this `calculator_program` is a calculator that i am making, with  easter eggs for me and my friends<br>
the `easterEgg()` function is the easter egg conformation.<br>
if you want to add an easter egg, ask in the discussions.<br>


to be clear this calculator can only to simple operations, and cant get an answer that is 10+, any answer higher than 10 will either say 3RR03, or wont be avalible
